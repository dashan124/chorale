title: Chorale’s got a new look
description: This month we updated our logo and upgraded our pages to make them look better. Or just acceptable, really. Plus, the legal agreement has been updated and we have a new contributor.

There’s not much to say other than what’s already been said. [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) got me very productive, I suppose!

+ First up, we have a new staff member! Her name is Rian, and she will be working on the backend of Chorale. Now, onto the news.
+ We finally picked a branding color: blue. Blue is a calming color and music, inherently, calms us!
+ New logo text! We are now using Montserrat, which looks more friendly.
+ There are also some small, subtle changes made to the logomark itself.
+ The logo should render way better since now it is used as a full SVG! What a beauty.
+ Actually, the whole site uses Montserrat now. So the logo text and body copy is identical. (Barring the changes in letter spacing.)
+ The homepage is new and shows how our mobile app looks like. A preview into the abyss of music, perhaps?
+ [The feature tour page](/tour) has been significantly redesigned. It now has colors, for example, which it did not have previously.
+ And, last off, the [legal stuff for Chorale](/legal) has been revised. We added summaries and everything!

So, that is everything for this week. Pretty good week, I would say, considering the old product tour [looked like this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/327137669953880065/366219702868901888/FireShot_Capture_25_-_Feature_Tour_I_Chorale_Music_-_https___www.choraleapp.com_tour.png). Ugh, gross. Hopefully you had a great week too!
