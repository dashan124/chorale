We’re glad to say that Chorale staff weren’t the only ones working this October. Thanks to some generous contributors, [an urgent UI bug on iOS was fixed](https://github.com/choraleapp/chorale/pull/7) and [another bug regarding currency switching](https://github.com/choraleapp/chorale/pull/10) was taken by the brave souls, oh so brave.

In all seriousness, it was nice feeling what the power of community can do. There are still a few days left in October, so if you hurry up, you can still get that T-Shirt and contribute to awesome projects, of course.

Back to Chorale business! For one, this blog has been redesigned from scratch.

+ A more simple & harmonic overall design
+ Latest post now highlighted up top
+ Easier to see more posts at once
+ Easier to subscribe for updates
+ Added pagination

Plus, the introduction of [syndicated posts](/blog/buying-music-legally-in-germany-2008) is quite exciting. We love helping creators reach new audiences and hear new thoughts.

Speaking of helping people, [we now have a Help Center](/support)! Search is on the way, and not everything is documented yet, but now you have one easy way to find solution to common problems.

Yet not only was the blog updated, the whole site was updated!

+ New, cleaner, smaller footer
+ New homepage design
+ Updated [branding](/brand) (the page and the doc)
+ Switched to a black and white color palette
+ Feature tour now on homepage

Plus, there were many bug fixes, a bunch of new articles popped up, and so on!
