description: Whether you are running a blog or publishing music, the Creative Commons license is a great license and sometimes even provides the best ROI for creators. So why is it not so widespread?

Let me start off by saying that, no, CC licenses do not solve every problem. I agree that major artists don’t even need to bother with the CC license, unless they’re making a free track, because their talent, existing fans, and (most likely) label will do a great job of spreading their work around.

However, let’s just say you’re starting out. Why not make some music that is released more openly? The advantage is that others (YouTubers, streamers, whatever) can use your music and the credit is worth much more when starting out compared to the money. You won’t be making serious money right off the bat. Unless you get recognized by some major celebrity or label, but that doesn’t happen every day.

But even if you’re already starting to get popular, don’t give up on the power of CC! Look what it did to Alan Walker, for example. Free tracks can also net you a lot of ad revenue on YouTube or on streaming services as well. So again, use CC to your advantage! Release free tracks every once in a while.

Let’s jump off of music for a bit and talk more generally about CC. When it comes to blogs, as you may have noticed, we’ve started syndicating posts on our blog. I’m talking about the [buying music legally in Germany, 2008](/blog/buying-music-legally-in-germany-2008-rant) rant. It’s great to take a look and compare how far we’ve come in just a bit less than 10 years and how much more we can do. CC gives everyone the freedom they deserve.

But not everyone even knows that there’s this other option. I’m guessing most people are aware that Creative Commons is, uhm, *there*, but don’t think about it as an option. Weirdly enough the first time I visibly saw the CC mark was from a *security researcher’s blog*. Which is a weird thing to say. A person, who professionally works on making sure systems are secure and such, is more than happy to use a loose license.

But don’t just take my word for it. [There are](https://scotthelme.co.uk/why-my-blog-is-creative-commons-licensed/) lots more [posts you can read](https://www.dailyblogtips.com/creative-commons-for-bloggers-explained/) about how CC [is really](https://thewavingcat.com/2009/05/02/new-license-for-this-blog-now-cc-by-licensed/) quite the [blessing](https://www.google.lt/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi-5PeNmYLXAhXhNpoKHarAAEoQFgg-MAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Ftroyhunt%2Fstatus%2F793366424282464256&usg=AOvVaw3j0_LD6UBO7bIC6s-yEzG1). And I’ll let you make up your own mind about CC. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below!
