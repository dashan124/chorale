What kind of music do you listen to? That’s a broad question of course, but really, what genre do you usually choose for music if you listen to it while working? The same stuff you always listen to? Hard EDM, atmospheric trance, what will it be?

What about game soundtracks? They set the atmosphere. Obviously, they are made for games, which you kind of have to get into to really enjoy. Right off the top of my head, I can think of 4 very memorable soundtracks which I’ll add here for your own listening pleasure:

If you have not tried listening to such music yet while studying, go ahead and give that stuff a go! Or, a more alternative approach would be to use something like [Noisli](https://noisli.com) which simulates fire, water, and other nature sounds.
