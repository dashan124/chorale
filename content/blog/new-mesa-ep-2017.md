Up until today, MESA has released just one short track: “Home”. But MESA is planning to craft a new EP with 2 or 3 songs. The artist says that this is going to take a while. After all, you have to mix, master, and write all the music.

While the contents of the EP or even the name of the EP is still uncertain, this EP is looking to be quite interesting, as the old preview called “Airplane Mode” [was redone](https://clyp.it/aear5yjb) and a new nameless track with an addictive rhythmic tone is already [up for listening](https://clyp.it/aear5yjb).

What do you think? Do you listen to future bass, and are you excited? You can catch MESA on the [Chorale Discord](https://discord.io/choraleapp), so make sure to say hi and tell him what you think! We’re sure he’d love to have some feedback on the EP.
