We once received a message from a visitor saying that they’d like to manually compile and use the open source code that powers Chorale to avoid any charges. After all, most people aren’t really sure on what “open source” actually means for them.

Pretty much every part of Chorale is open source: the main website, the web-powered desktop client, the mobile progressive app, the API, even these docs are open source! However, Chorale is structured in such a way that we can keep working in the open without making major security compromises.

You see, what you’re paying for is API access. We run our own production server database and API — the official one, if you shall say so — and it always has the latest updates, including important security updates. But what’s most important for you is the music you want to listen to! We work with labels and artists to make sure they’re in a safe environment that they can flourish in. Not to mention that fact that by giving us just a few dollars a month, you’re helping support the development and hard work that goes into making Chorale great.

The great part about making Chorale open source is you can change it to make it work however you want. So you can work to add a new feature to the desktop client just for yourself, but the changes you make will go out to everywhere, which fulfils our goal of creating the best music player, that’s made for everyone and literally by everyone.
