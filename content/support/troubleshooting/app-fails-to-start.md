If your app cannot seem to get past the loading screen, there are a few steps you can take to make sure the problem is on our side or yours. So first, make sure that the problem is not caused by you by following these steps *carefully*:

## No internet

Check if you have an internet connection. Visit at least 10 websites (ranging in popularity) from the machine you are using to make sure other sites are display properly.

If all sites load flawleslly, you can go to the next step. If not, contact your internet service provider (ISP).

## Unstable internet

Your internet connection may be spotty (where some things load faster than others, videos and images for example) or you may have packet loss. All data on the internet, including websites, images, and audio, is made up of packets. If your browser does not correctly download these packets, because of a bad connection or otherwise, Chorale may not function or look the way that it’s supposed to.

Search for “packet loss” and “internet speed tests” to check your connection’s integrity.

We recommend using [fast.com](https://fast.com) to quickly check your real-world connection to Netflix or the good old [Ookla Speed Test](https://beta.speedtest.net). Keep in mind that some innocuous internet service providers (ISPs) may cheat some tests by raising your speed just for these tests, but this is not a big problem in most parts of the world.

Typically, you need a broadband connection (which is at the very least 4 Mbps) to get a reasonable Chorale experience. If you are experiencing any of these issues, you may want to contact your internet service provider (ISP).

## Outdated browser

Chorale only supports some browsers. If your browser is not in this list, it is not supported and you should use a different browser (if possible).

### Priority support

We will do our very best to make sure these browsers get the best experience possible:

+ last 2 versions of Google Chrome or Chromium for desktop and Android
+ last 2 versions of Firefox for desktop and Android

If you are not using these browsers, or the browsers are outdated, go to the next step.

(The versions are counted from the stable branch.)

### Secondary support

These browsers may not support all of Chorale’s features, but should work for most day-to-day purposes.

+ latest version of Safari/WebKit and all browsers on iOS
+ latest version of Microsoft Edge for Windows

### Gray-zone support

These browsers should, in theory, get the best possible support because they are using the same engine as our recommended browser. However, these creators have created a so-called “fork” and can choose to dismiss updated versions of the engine they are using or even make changes that cut certain features which were present in the original version of the engine.

Because of this, these browsers do not fall into either the priority or secondary support category.

+ Vivaldi
+ Opera
+ Samsung Browser for Android
+ Microsoft Edge for Android

## Incorrect settings

Ask yourself these questions:

### Is JavaScript enabled?

> Nowadays almost all web pages contain JavaScript, a scripting programming language that runs on visitor’s web browser. It makes web pages functional for specific purposes and if disabled for some reason, the content or the functionality of the web page can be limited or unavailable.

On [enable-javascript.com](https://www.enable-javascript.com/), you can find instructions on how to enable (activate) JavaScript in the 5 most commonly used browsers.

### Are cookies enabled?

You may need to enable cookies to make sure Chorale functions properly. [Learn more](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-enable-cookies/)

### Are your extensions blocking Chorale?

If you have a blocker of some sort, for ads or tracking, disable that. Yes, we understand the need for privacy and unintrusive advertising, but these blockers can sometimes do more damage than good. If you’re concerned about privacy, read our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) and [Terms of Service](/legal/terms).

## Is Chorale down?
