Pressed play but cannot seem to get music to play? Check out the following solutions.

## You’re using the wrong account

Different accounts get different access to features and music selection.

## The content has been set to release worldwide gradually

For example, Australian fans get newly released music at midnight in their timezone, but listeners from the United States have to wait until it’s midnight for them to listen to the content. It’s possible to see such content, but not listen to it.

## The content you are trying to view has been removed

The artist may have deleted the content you are trying to access or the legal terms may have changed.
