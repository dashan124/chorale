Pressed play and you see that the music is progressing but there is no sound? Check some things first!

## Is this a Chorale issue?

Are your speakers switched on? Are your headphones fully inserted? Is all of your audio hardware functioning properly? To test this, try playing from an alternative source or device. For example, YouTube!

This may just be a system issue, where Chorale is not responsible for anything.

If you are hearing sound from YouTube but not Chorale, check the next step.

## Is the volume right?

Sometimes devices have multiple volume settings. One for the app itself and another as the master volume control.

+ Windows? [Check this page](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/no-sound-on-windows-8-7).
+ macOS? [Check here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203186)

Using Linux? Many distros have similiarities to macOS or Windows, so check both articles and look for audio settings on your machine.

## Check for updates

Chorale may have a major update that needs to be downloaded before use. The same could be said about your hardware or operating system (OS) as well.
