## When, how, where can I get started?

Early access gives users and creators the ability to test the platform and its new features. Testers report bugs and take their time to give honest, concise feedback at a leisurely pace.

Joining is easy!

+ Correctly fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/7TnqL2AOOgcDJWKE2)
+ Wait a few days, up to a week
+ Check your email and use the link to sign up

See? I told you it was simple.

## But wait, I donâ€™t use Discord!

Sorry, all testers must use Discord regularly. If you cannot fulfill this requirement, you cannot be a member of the Early Access program. You can get a Discord account for free right now at [discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com).

## Will I have to pay for this?

No, this is entirely free.

## Are there any geographic restrictions?

At this time, we are trying to provide access to everyone from every part of the world.

## Do I have to keep everything secret?

No! We are not trying to keep Chorale tucked away from everyone. Feel free to tell people about Chorale, in fact, we encourage you to spread the word! However, as with every closed community service, please make sure to keep your account secure by using the tools we provide you with. You are responsible for your account and losing access to it, or someone malicious gaining access to your account, is something you should absolutely avoid.
